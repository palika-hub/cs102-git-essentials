# cs102-git-essentials
first i created a github repository with the name cs102-git-essentials and made it public
after that i cloned the repository into a folder name cs102-git-essentials with the cd git clone git@github.com:<your GitHub username>/cs102-git-essentials.git
then i created a empty file with the name  cs102-lecture-notes.txt 
now  i commit changes. That means the current state of the files/folders will be stored in the git repository permanently.
git commit -m "type a message to name the changes"
Once the changes are committed it can be pushed to the server repository
